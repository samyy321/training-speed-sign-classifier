# training-speed-sign-classifier
Training a deep learning model for speed roadsign classification.

Method inspired by: https://towardsdatascience.com/recognizing-traffic-signs-with-over-98-accuracy-using-deep-learning-86737aedc2ab which provides more than 98% validation accuracy on the dataset.

The images used for training are from German speed traffic signs retrieved here: http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset
